To run your Django app with the "fullcontact" user ID, you should make sure that the user "fullcontact" has the necessary permissions to execute the application and access the required files. Here's how to run the server using the "fullcontact" user:

Activate the Virtual Environment:

If you are using a virtual environment, activate it as the "fullcontact" user:

bash
Copy code
su - fullcontact -c 'source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate'
This command switches to the "fullcontact" user and activates the virtual environment.

Navigate to Your Project's Directory:

Change your working directory to the root directory of your Django project:

bash
Copy code
su - fullcontact -c 'cd /path/to/your/django/project'
Run the Development Server or Gunicorn:

Depending on your deployment method, you can run the development server or Gunicorn with the "fullcontact" user. Here's how to run the development server:

bash
Copy code
su - fullcontact -c 'python manage.py runserver'
Or, if you're using Gunicorn, you can run it as the "fullcontact" user:

bash
Copy code
su - fullcontact -c 'gunicorn your_project.wsgi'
Replace your_project.wsgi with the actual path to your project's WSGI application.

By following these steps, you can run your Django app using the "fullcontact" user ID. Ensure that the "fullcontact" user has the necessary permissions to access the application files and that the virtual environment is activated within the user's context.
